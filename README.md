# IBM Quantum Computer Tracker
  Collects and displays data on usage of IBM quantum computers
  
  This repository includes a webapp that queries the firebase database and displays the data, and a python script that updates the database.
  
  The python script for updating the database is tested on python 3.8.5 and 3.8.6. If the build wheel for psutils fails on Linux see this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21530577/fatal-error-python-h-no-such-file-or-directory.
