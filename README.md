  If you have trouble setting up it, try with the same python and virtualenv and pip versions as in pyenv.cfg. If it doesn't work you might need the visual studio C build tools. I'm not 100% sure qiskit needs them but it creates a CMakeLists.txt file and I have the build tools installed locally so that might be why it works for me.
